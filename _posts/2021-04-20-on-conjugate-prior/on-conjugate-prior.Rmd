```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

The audience would be someone who familiar with probability, dericvative and integral.

beta distribution is conjugate prior for binomial distribution.

example on binomial distribution, with specified prior and calculate the posterior based on data the retrieve.


## Case Study

Let's assume we have monitored the occurrence of a disease in our pond. The data is shown below:

```{r}
ponds <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 
           1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
mean(ponds)
```
if we found the disease in a particular pond, we label it as `1`, and `0` otherwise.
